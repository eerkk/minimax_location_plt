# Emergency Service Facility Location Optimization

This project implements a solution to determine optimal locations for emergency service facilities using a minimax approach. The code calculates the best locations based on given subdivisions, ensuring minimal maximum distance to any subdivision.

## Features

- Calculates optimal locations for emergency service facilities.
- Visualizes subdivisions and optimal locations using Matplotlib.
- Provides clear output of optimal points and maximum distance.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
